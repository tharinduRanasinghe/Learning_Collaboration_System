            <h1 class="display-4">User Expectations</h1>
            <p class="lead">These forums are available to help you solve any problem that occured to you when doing course work or finding course work. We offer these forums for free for all users of Auaha, in the hopes that they can join us in improving the quality of Auaha as a project as well as a learning tool.</p>
            <p class="lead">Above all, users are expected to be kind, helpful, and respectful. Assume the best of people and try to make things better. Beyond just seeking solutions, users are encouraged to help others. If they know the answer to someone else’s question, it is greatly appreciated that they offer assistance. This is by no means mandatory, and no one is compelled to help anyone else.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="jumbotron">
            <h1 class="display-4">Guidelines</h1>
            <p class="lead">Guideline violations will result in posting access being restricted by first being flagged for moderation. This will require a moderator to approve a user’s posts. This restriction is meant to be temporary, and will be lifted when the moderators feel the situation has been resolved. If a user cannot follow the guidelines after that, their account will be blocked from posting. Further actions (such as restricting access to Auaha as a whole) can and will be applied if necessary.</p>
            <h1 class="display-6">Hate Speech</h1>
            <p class="lead">We want you to use Auaha Forums to express your opinions, even very controversial ones. But, don't cross the line by publishing hate speech. By this, we mean content that promotes hate or violence towards groups based on race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, disability, gender, age, veteran status, or sexual orientation/gender identity. For example, don't write a post saying that members of Race X are criminals or advocating violence against followers of Religion Y</p>
            <h1 class="display-6">Violence</h1>
            <p class="lead">Don't threaten other people on your group or messages. For example, don't post threating comments against another person or group of people and don't post content encouraging your readers to take violent action against another person or group of people..</p>
            <h1 class="display-6">Warn About Adult Content</h1>
            <p class="lead">We do not allow any adult content on Auaha  Forums, which includes images or videos that contain nudity or sexual activity.</p>
            <h1 class="display-6">Personal and confidential information</h1>
            <p class="lead">It's not ok to publish another person's personal and confidential information. For example, don't post someone else's credit card numbers, , unlisted phone numbers, and driver's license numbers. Also, please keep in mind that in most cases, information that is already available elsewhere on the Internet or in public records is not considered to be private or confidential under our policies.</p>
            <h1 class="display-6">Impersonation and misrepresentation of identity</h1>
            <p class="lead">Do not impersonate a person or organization or misrepresent yourself. This includes impersonating any person or organizations you don’t represent; providing misleading information about a user/site’s identity, qualifications, ownership, purpose, products, services, or business; or falsely implying affiliation with, or endorsement by, another individual or organization. This also includes content or accounts misrepresenting or concealing their ownership or primary purpose, such as misrepresenting or intentionally concealing your country of origin or other material details about yourself when directing content about politics, social issues, or matters of public concern to users in a country other than your own. We do allow parody, satire, and the use of pseudonyms or pen names—just avoid content that is likely to mislead your audience about your true identity.</p>
            <h1 class="display-6">Do Not Spam</h1>
            <p class="lead">Spam takes several forms on Groups, all of which can result in deletion of your account. Some examples include creating similar multiple comments, posting replies on other people’s messages just to promote your site or product, and scraping existing content from other sources for the primary purpose of generating revenue or other personal gains.</p>
            <h1 class="display-6">Do Not Offer to Pay for Help</h1>
            <p class="lead">Any thread that offers any service for money can be closed at any time. We are not against paid services but these forums are not the right place for them.</p>
            <h1 class="display-6">Do Not Offer to Work For Hire</h1>
            <p class="lead">Don’t offer to work for hire in replies on these forums. Help on the forums should be given freely, any violators will be strictly suspneded.</p>
            <h1 class="display-6">Do Not Post About Commercial Products </h1>
            <p class="lead">Any post regarding a commercial product is strictly prohibited</p>
